# hello: a minimalist template for personal websites on Github Pages

## Why **hello**?  
  
**hello** has a simple goal: to make Github Pages accessible to everyone.  
  

**hello** is a minimalist template that lets you design a beautiful website or portfolio on Github Pages - without installing a Ruby
development environment, learning to use Jekyll, **or even typing a single line of code**. It's ideal for GitHubbers
who want to start building their personal website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but maybe aren't so familiar with web development.
  

The default layout of **hello** is a streamlined single page with three major customizable sections: a required "about" section, an optional portfolio, and an optional CTA. Using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) variables declared by in the config and index files, **hello** offers an easy-to-use design where all customizations necessary for a basic personal website can be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  


**hello** is adapted from [Twenty](https://html5up.net/twenty), a responsive, mobile-friendly theme by HTML5 Up.  

## Template information
Twenty by HTML5 UP

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


This is Twenty, a minimal, multi-page responsive site template for HTML5 UP.

As the name implies, this is my twentieth (!) design for HTML5 UP. Since the last
few have been single page affairs, I decided to go with something a bit more conventional
and threw in four extra page layouts. Beyond that, it's the usual drill: fully responsive,
built on HTML5/CSS3/skel, and CCA licensed like all my other stuff. Sass sources are
also included for those of you into that sort of thing (entirely optional).

Special thanks to Michael Domaradzki (md.photomerchant.net) for allowing me to use
his excellent photos in Twenty's demo*.
