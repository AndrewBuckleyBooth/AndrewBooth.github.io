### why **hello**?  
  
**hello** has a simple goal: to make Github Pages accessible for everyone.  
  

**hello** is a minimalist template that lets you design a beautiful website or portfolio on Github Pages - without installing a Ruby
development environment, learning to use Jekyll, **or even typing a single line of code**. It's ideal for GitHubbers
who want to start building their personal website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but maybe aren't so familiar with web development. With **hello**'s easy-to-use design, all customizations necessary for a basic personal website can be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  
  

**hello** is adapted from [Twenty](https://html5up.net/twenty), a responsive, mobile-friendly theme by HTML5 Up.
